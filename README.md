The Ninite script is to be used in conjunction with Ninite's Ninite Pro service. The idea of the script is to be run as a scheduled task on a server and for it to update all the software on your network.

It's not supposed to be super fancy, but it is supposed to help low budget companies, charities, startups getting over the hurdle of software patching within an organization.
